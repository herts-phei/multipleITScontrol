## Overview

The goal of multipleITScontrol is to provide functions to easily wrangle data collected for an intervention and to perform interrupted time series statistical analysis, involving tracking a long-term period before and after a intervention at a defined point in time to assess the intervention's effects, along with methods allowing for comparing the outcomes for the treated units with those of a control/comparison unit, and to allow for multiple successive interventions.

A lot of the code is derived and inspired from the rpub article [A pragmatic Introduction to Interrupted Time Series](https://rpubs.com/chrissyhroberts/1006858) by Chrissy Roberts, many thanks goes to him.

Interrupted-time series (ITS) is a quasi-experimental study design for evaluating the impact of an intervention or successive interventions that are implemented at defined moments in time. This is much more informative than an end-point analysis which only allows an understanding of differences between the final situations, rather than establishing how the different interventions influenced an outcome. In practice, ITS models are useful to establish an underlying trend over time and understand the effect of “interrupting” this trend with the interventions that are implemented. The trend that would have been expected to continue occurring without the intervention is called the “counterfactual” scenario, and the impact of introducing the intervention is typically determined by comparing whether there was a difference in this counterfactual trend, and the trend that arose after the intervention.

In a more complex situation however, a second counterfactual scenario can be considered by introducing a “control” group that is not subject to the intervention. A controlled ITS study helps in understanding the effect of interventions when the underlying trend is expected to change in a time-varied manner that has not been, or cannot be, accounted for. For example, a possible scenario could be that the underlying trend will change due to seasonality.

More information on ITS models and controlled ITS models can be found in Lopez Bernal, Cummins, and Gasparrini (2016, 2018).

## Installation

You can install the development version of multipleITScontrol from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("herts-phei/multipleITScontrol")
```

## Pre-requisites

In order for the package functions to work properly, there are several requirements to be met for the data frame containing the time series data:

-   To successfully implement an ITS model, data must be collected consistently before and after the intervention, which must be implemented at a defined point in time. For this package, a minimum of 3 equal interval time points in each intervention period and in the pre-intervention period are needed

-   Defined impact model whether the interventions were expected to result in a sudden change (a “level” or “step” change, or both); currently, the package only supports the same impact model for each intervention.

-   Power calculations to ensure sufficient statistical power in the intervention of interest should be performed, but this is beyond the scope of the package and should be performed independently.

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem with two stage interrupted time series with a control:

**Background**: Alpine Meadow School and Forest Tiger School have similar student demographics, including socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and academic performance. Both schools are part of Clarkson County's public school district.

Alpine Meadow School wants to trial out two new interventions to improve their school's reading comprehension score, and to compare post intervention results with the pre-intervention score.

**Intervention 1: Implementing a New Reading Programme**

-   **Objective:** Improve reading comprehension and literacy rates among students.
-   **Start Date:** September 1, 2025
-   **Duration:** 6 months
-   **Description:** The school introduces a new, evidence-based reading program that includes daily reading sessions, interactive reading activities, and regular assessments.
-   **Measurement:** Reading comprehension scores from standardized tests administered weekly.

**Intervention 2: Introducing Peer Tutoring Sessions**

-   **Objective:** Further enhance reading comprehension and literacy rates.
-   **Start Date:** March 1, 2026 (immediately after the reading program ends)
-   **Duration:** 6 months
-   **Description:** The school implements peer tutoring sessions where older students tutor younger students in reading. These sessions are held twice a week and focus on reading comprehension strategies and practice.
-   **Measurement:** Reading comprehension scores from standardized tests administered weekly.

### Controlled Interrupted Time Series Design

**Step 1: Baseline Period**

-   **Duration:** 6 months (March 1, 2025 - August 31, 2025)
-   **Data Collection:** Collect baseline data on reading comprehension scores administered weekly.

**Step 2: Intervention 1 Period**

-   **Duration:** 6 months (September 1, 2025 - February 28, 2026)
-   **Data Collection:** Continue collecting data on reading comprehension scores during the reading program administered weekly.

**Step 3: Intervention 2 Period**

-   **Duration:** 6 months (March 1, 2026 - August 31, 2026)
-   **Data Collection:** Collect data on reading comprehension scores during the peer tutoring sessions administered weekly.

The calendar plot below summarises the timeline of the interventions:

        plot.caption = element_text(size = rel(0.5)),
        legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.5)))
